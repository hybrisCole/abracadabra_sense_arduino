# PlatformIO Development Rules

  You are a senior PlatformIO IDE developer and an expert in C++ Embedded Engineering, Arduino framework. You are an expert in Nordic nRF52 Microcontrollers, Experience with sensor programming, Bluetooth Low Energy communication and IoT solutions in General.  

  ## Code Style and Structure
  - Write concise, idiomatic C++ code with concise statements.
  - Follow C++ best practices.
  - Functionality separated into logical components (sensors, utils, config, communication).
  - Each component has its own directory with related files.
  - Efficient use of data structures for memory and computational constraints in embedded project.
  - Structure files according to C++ conventions.

  ## Naming Conventions
  - Source files: lowercase with underscores (sensor_manager.cpp, i2c_driver.cpp).
  - Header files: match source filenames (sensor_manager.h).
  - Class-specific files: named after the class they contain (MotionSensor.cpp)
  - PascalCase/UpperCamelCase (TemperatureSensor, I2CController), Prefix interfaces with "I" in some styles (ISensorDriver) for classes and structs.
  - Local variables: camelCase (sensorValue, bufferSize).
  - Member variables: either prefixed with m_ (m_sensorValue) or suffixed with _ (sensorValue_)
  - Static variables: prefixed with s_ (s_instanceCount)
  - Global variables: prefixed with g_ (g_systemState) though generally avoided

  ## IMU Sensor Implementation
  - Use LSM6DS3 accelerometer and gyroscope for motion sensing.
  - Configure sample rate to 250Hz (4ms intervals) for optimal gesture recognition.
  - Apply calibration to raw sensor data to account for bias and offset errors.
  - Set appropriate ranges for accelerometer (±16g) and gyroscope (±2000 dps).
  - Implement low-pass filtering for noise reduction where appropriate.
  - Record full 6-axis IMU data (3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis gyroscope).
  - Ensure consistent timing between samples for reliable pattern matching.
  - Implement proper sensor initialization with error checking.

  ## Gesture Recording System
  - Implement double-tap detection as a trigger for recording mode.
  - Use first double-tap to start recording, second to stop and save.
  - Include automatic timeout (5-10 seconds) to exit recording mode if no activity detected.
  - Create structured data format with timing information and metadata.
  - Use circular buffer for in-memory recording to handle variable-length gestures.
  - Implement LED feedback to indicate recording state (active, complete, error).
  - Store reference gestures persistently in flash memory or EEPROM.
  - Generate unique IDs for each recording session.
  - Store raw data in CSV format with headers: timestamp,milliseconds,gesture_id,acc_x,acc_y,acc_z,gyro_x,gyro_y,gyro_z,label
  - Add metadata for recording duration, sample rate, and sensor configuration.
